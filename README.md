# Task Management Application Project

This task management application demonstrates usage of Bootstrap to build a website.  All pages have a navbar which directs to the landing page, registration page, and sign in page.  On smaller screens, the navbar will collapse to a hamburger button and cards will stack vertically.

## Landing Page

The landing page has a jumbotron with a welcome message, and cards with buttons that direct to the dashboard, task details, and new task pages.  Following the cards is a FAQ section with an accordion for questions and answers.

## Dashboard

The dashboard displays a list of tasks via cards, which will stack vertically on small screens.  There are buttons on each to edit the tasks, as well as delete them (the delete button is just for example purposes and is not functional).

## Task Details

The task details page displays a single card with the task name and detail.  There are forms to edit the task name and details.  Though these are not functional, they do perform validation.

## Create task

The create task page has forms prompting the user for a task name and description.  Much like the forms in the task details page, they are not functional, but perform validation.
